                    A picture says more than thousand words. We have prepared a screencast of the desired result.
                    Have a look at it now.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Task</h2>
                <p>Create 2 "classes":</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One class (container) creates draggable containers</li>
                    <li>Other class (node) creates draggable nodes that can be dropped in instances of the latter</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once an instance of node is dropped on an instance of container
                    the node rests in the container and moves together with the container.
                </p>
                <p>When removed from the container the node will move independently again.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="section">
                <h2>Prioritized goals</h2>
                <h3>Must have</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everything is generated programmatically</li>
                    <li>"containers" are draggable</li>
                    <li>"nodes" are draggable and can be dropped in instances of container</li>
                    <li>Once a node is dropped on a container it becomes part of the container and "follows" its new parent</li>
                    <li>Instances of node are detachable from the container</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>On best effort</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow dropping nodes from one container to the other</li>
                    <li>Visually indicate valid drop targets. Highlight or set a different border when the dragged node enters a valid drop target</li>
                    <li>Add some eye candy and make it look nice</li>
                    <li>Try to have some fun with the task ;)</li>

                <h2>Constraints</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may use <strong>any</strong> framework you want however we expect that you keep the dependencies to a minimum.</li>
                    <li>Use the DOM (HTML/SVG). Do NOT use canvas</li>
                    <li>Do NOT webpack a simple thing like this. It must run without having to trigger any build jobs or unnecessary scaffolding.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="color: #FF0000;">No markup allowed.</span>
                        Everything is meant to be created programmatically
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time: Spend no longer than 4 hours.
                        We also accept partial solution as long as you tackle aspects
                        of the task in ascending order. MUST HAVES come first.
